# jQuery Workshop
Starting small, we use this template to fiddle around with jQuery.

## Third Task:
- Change the opacity of the image back to 100% if the mouse hovers over it
- A click on the image shows the text block below the images
- the 'hidden' class should be removed from the textbox if it is visible

Have fun :-)
