# jQuery Workshop
Starting small, we use this template to fiddle around with jQuery.

## First Task:
- implement jQuery in this website
    - use the file from the obj/js/ folder
    - or use the google library
        - https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js

- write a console output when the DOM is ready

Have fun :-)
