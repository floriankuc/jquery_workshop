# jQuery Workshop
Starting small, we use this template to fiddle around with jQuery.

## Third Task:
- Change the opacity of every single image back to 1.0 if the mouse hovers over it. (use the .fadeTo() function if you like).
- Change the opacity back to 0.5 if the mouse leaves the Image.
- A click on the image displays the text box below the images.
    - The click should highlight that image with a yellow border.
    - The highlighting should only be shown at the last clicked image.

Have fun :-)
