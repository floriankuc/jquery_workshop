# jQuery Workshop
Starting small, we use this template to fiddle around with jQuery.

## Second Task:
- Select all of the artist images and change their opacity to 0.5 with jQuery
- Hide the text box with jQuery (just for learning purposes)
- Additionally add a class with the name 'hidden' to the text box
- Delete the console.log

Have fun :-)
