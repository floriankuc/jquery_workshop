# jQuery Workshop
Starting small, we use this template to fiddle around with jQuery.

## ATTENTION!:
This task is not for you guys! It requires things you don't know yet. Chill and move on to the next task ;-)

## Fifth Task:
- Fire a POST request with jQuery Ajax to the url I give you.
- Switch the data received with the backend mock from before.
- Add an error path for the case that the server is not responding or sends an error and print it to the console.

Have fun :-)
