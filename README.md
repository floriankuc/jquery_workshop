# jQuery Workshop
Starting small, we use this template to fiddle around with jQuery.

## Third Task:
- Change the opacity of an image back to 100% if the mouse hovers over it
- A click on the image displays the text box below the images
- the 'hidden' class should be removed from the text box if it is visible

Have fun :-)
