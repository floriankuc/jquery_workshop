# jQuery Workshop
Starting small, we use this template to fiddle around with jQuery.

## Third Task:
- Change the opacity of an image back to 100% if the mouse hovers over it (use the .fadeTo() function if you like)
- Change the opacity back to 0.5 if the mouse leaves the Image.
- A click on the image displays the text box below the images
- the 'hidden' class should be removed from the text box if it is visible

Have fun :-)
