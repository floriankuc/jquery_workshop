# jQuery Workshop
Starting small, we use this template to fiddle around with jQuery.

## First Task:
- implement jQuery in the cloned website
    - Use the jQuery .js file from the obj/js/ folder
    - OR use the google library:
        - https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js
    - Add a file with the name "script.js" in the obj folder
    - Write a console output when the DOM is ready
        - Add your code inside the script.js file

Have fun :-)
